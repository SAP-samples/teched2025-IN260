10.  For login, use “UserXX,” where XX is the number on your desk. The trainers will provide the password.
11.  Create a new *Integration Package* named “IN260-UserXX” (replace XX with your user number) and save the package.
12. Navigate to the package “TechEd 2025 - IN260 - Post Processing Flows” and open the *Artifacts* tab.
13. In the *Actions* column, use the “…” menu to *Copy* the *iFlow*. Rename it by replacing “copy” with “UserXX” (replace XX with your user number). Set the destination *Package* to the one you created in step 9.
14. Navigate to the copied *iFlow* and configure it by setting the *User ID* to your number (XX). Then *Deploy* the *iFlow*.
